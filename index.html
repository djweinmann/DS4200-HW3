        Hi, I'm Dylan Weinmann. I'm a third year Data Science student
        atNortheastern University. I’m excited to have made this website for you
        to browse through and hopefully it can help you learn a bit more about
        me. I’m initially from Seattle, Washington and have lived there my whole
        life up until my freshman year of college. Since then, I’ve lived in
        Boston for school, but I did take my first semester abroad in London. I
        have two younger brothers, aged 13 and 17, and two pet dogs named Dixie
        and Selah. When I’m home, I like to spend a lot of time outdoors. I used
        to do this mostly through running on my school’s track and cross country
        teams throughout high school, but since graduating I’ve gotten more into
        hiking. The mountains to the east of Seattle are beautiful and have
        limitless hikes that are fantastic in the summer. In the winter, I used
        to love skiing, but haven’t as much in recent years. In Boston during
        school I don’t have as much time to be outdoors, but I do get quite a
        bit of time walking to and from class every day. My biggest activity I
        do here is rock climbing, which I’ll go into more depth about on my
        special interest page!
