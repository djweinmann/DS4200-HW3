      <p>
        I got into bouldering the summer of 2022, right before I was headed to
        London for my first semester of college. It felt like a good way to stay
        active after I was done with running and two of my friends started at
        the same time so I had a good group to go with. I loved it right off the
        bat and continued doing it when I was abroad, and now have been climbing
        consistently for over two years! I’ve met many of my closest friends
        through climbing, even one of my roommates and my girlfriend. I love how
        it doesn’t just challenge my body, but each individual climb is a puzzle
        that I need to solve, and there can be many different solutions that
        work for different people. So far I’ve only ever climbed indoors in
        gyms, but I’m excited to get the chance to go and explore some outdoor
        climbs this coming spring and summer. As much as I do love climbing, it
        does have some definite downsides. It’s a big time commitment having to
        travel to the gym and back, and I’ve faced multiple injuries due to
        overwork in my arms. Despite this, I intend to keep climbing for a long
        time and love it as a hobby.
